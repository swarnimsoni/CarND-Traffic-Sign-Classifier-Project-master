## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Neural Network
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

In this project I have attempted to build a Neural Network to classify german traffic signs of 43 types. The project uses anaconda, python3, tensorflow and other tools/packages. I have conducted several experiments with different architectures and hyper paramenter values. The final solution is in notebook __Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb__. And the final report is in writeup_report.md.
